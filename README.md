## Description
I built this app to give the user the ability to search through and update their database.

## User Story

```
As a user 
I want to see my database
When I see my database I want to an individual user
Then I want to be able to update that user
When the user is updated I want the ability to delete that user

I also want to see the friendCount
When I see the friendCount 
Then I want to add or remove friends
```
